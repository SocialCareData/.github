**Triage process for issues**

This document outlines a streamlined process for managing issues in this GitHub repository, focusing on efficiency and clarity. The process will be completed on a weekly basis by the community manager.

**The triage process**

* Review: Check newly opened issues.

* Validate:
   * Is it a real issue (not spam or a general question)?
   * Is all necessary information present?
   * Is it a duplicate? If so, close it and link to the original.
   * Is the issue in the right place? If not, transfer to the correct repository.

* Categorize: Apply relevant labels.

* Type: Assign a type.

* Urgency: Check to see whether issue is an urgent one or not. If no urgency added, add the relevant tag.

* Initial Assignment: Assign to a team member if clear.

* Review: Check previous issues
   * Are there new comments? Is there anything we need to action?
   * Are there any issues that are finished and need to be closed?

The issues will then be reviewed on a weekly basis amongst the project team.
