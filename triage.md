**Triage process for issues**

This document outlines a streamlined process for managing issues in this GitHub repository, focusing on efficiency and clarity. The process will be completed on a weekly basis by the community manager.

**The triage process**

* Review: Check newly opened issues.

* Validate:
   * Is it a real issue (not spam or a general question)?
   * Is all necessary information present?
   * Is it a duplicate? If so, close it and link to the original.
   * Is the issue in the right place? If not, transfer to the correct repository.

* Categorize: Apply relevant labels.

* Type: Assign a type.

* Urgency: Check to see whether issue is an urgent one or not. If no urgency added, add the relevant tag.

* Initial Assignment: Assign to a relevant team member.

* Review: Check previous issues
   * Are there new comments? Is there anything we need to action?
   * Are there any issues that are finished and need to be closed?

The issues will then be reviewed on a weekly basis amongst the project team. 

**Project Team Scrum**

Each week the project team will meet to go through the current issues. 

Each team member will share the issues they have been assigned, share their thoughts and research that they have conducted over the past week.

The project team will then decide whether we believe we can action the issue immediately, and the assigned team member will take it away to complete. If the team thinks we need further input into a specific decision, we will hold the issues for further discussion at the monthly working group meeting. 

The community manager will update the issues with the relevant decisions from the scrum meeting.
